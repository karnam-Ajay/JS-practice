# javascript and classes.
# oop
it is a programming paradigm and code structure.

## objects
-- collection of properties and methods.

# why use oop
to minimize clumsyness in code 

# parts of oop
object literals {} -- it means simply one object

-Constructors
-Prototypes
-Classes
-Instances(new,this)

## 4 pillars of oop
1.Abstraction --> hides the details 

2.Encapsulation --> giving access to details only we need to show to user and wrapping sensitive data in private variable.

3.Inheritance --> Extending the classes

4.Polymorphism --> one method doing multiple works.
